How to Run PHP on Localhost 

Step 1: Install a local web server stack (includes PHP, Apache, MySQL)
Popular options:

XAMPP (Windows, macOS, Linux) â€” https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

Step 2: Start the server
Open your control panel (e.g., XAMPP Control Panel)

Start Apache (and MySQL if needed)

Apache is your web server that serves PHP files

Step 3: Put your PHP files in the web root
For XAMPP, the root folder is usually:


C:\xampp\htdocs\
For MAMP on Mac:


/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/
Copy your project folder (e.g., myshop) inside htdocs.

Step 4: Open your PHP project in a browser
Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost/myshop/
This will load index.php or your default page.

Step 5: Work and test!
Edit your PHP files in your project folder.

Refresh the browser to see changes.
